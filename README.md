# W3B Fund Management

This decentralized application (dApp) enables users to invest ETH in a decentralized fund in exchange for ERC20 tokens, symbolizing ownership in the fund. For each 0.1 ETH contributed, investors receive 1 W3B token, with the minimum investment threshold set at 0.1 ETH.

The fund's administrator has the authority to propose expenditure requests for the organization's benefit, including funding for events or charitable contributions under the auspices of the Web3 at University of Toronto Organization.

Expenditure proposals require approval from at least 85% of the token holders. Once this threshold is met, the administrator can disburse the designated amount of ETH to a specified wallet address.
